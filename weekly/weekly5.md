## Weekly report #5

20 hours.

Progress:
* Implemented Red-Black Tree
* Implemented optimal Huffman code building
* More unit testing
* Started writing implementation & testing documents

The program now constructs an optimal Huffman code for the input file
and prints it out. The code is not actually used for compression yet.

Next week:
* Add comments to all source code files
* Expand coverage of unit testing
* Implement compression using dynamic Huffman codes
* Start working on length/distance compression

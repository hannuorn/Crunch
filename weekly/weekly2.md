## Weekly report #2

During the 2nd week I was extremely busy and could only use about 4 hours to study the Deflate specification. Unfortunately, I did not have the time to start writing code. However, the project is pretty much on track since the most important goal of understanding the Deflate specification was achieved.


### Goals achieved

* Read the Deflate specification
* Created a project in GNAT Programming Studio

### Goals for next week

Since Deflate decompression is a straightforward process compared to the somewhat tricky compression, I plan to start by implementing the decompression routine. This should make it easier to get started and to get a deeper understanding of Deflate format. I plan to invest about 15 hours on the project during the 3rd week, which should be enough to more or less complete the decompression routines.
